My github account is a new one since I am currently learning about how to use it. 
This respository is for my assigments so that my professor can access my coding easily. 
With me having a github account a few weeks prior, I had to first create a new repository. After I was finished with that, I then went to download github desktop. After that is downloaded, I then go to file, and click "clone repsository. I click on the repository that I wanted to clone while also insuring that I can rememeber where on my local machine it was saved.
